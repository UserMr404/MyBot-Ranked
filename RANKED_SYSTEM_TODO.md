# MyBot Ranked Attack System Implementation TODO

## Overview
Complete rework of attack system to support Normal and Ranked attack modes:
- Normal Mode: Uses existing search and attack settings (current system)
- Ranked Mode: No search capability, attacks first base found, 8 attacks/day limit, separate troop/attack settings
- Daily limit resets at 7 AM each day

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Design architecture and implementation plan
- [x] Modify daily reset mechanism to reset at 7 AM

- [x] Create new PrepareSearch function with Normal/Ranked detection  
- [x] Create Ranked GUI tab file (MBR GUI Design Child Attack - Ranked.au3)
- [x] Update button detection in imglocAuxiliary.au3
- [x] Modify main runBot function for ranked logic
- [x] Create ranked attack functions (RankedAttack, RankedStandardAttack, etc.)
- [x] Update config save/load functions for ranked settings
- [x] Create ranked army training functions
- [x] Add GUI integration to main attack tab
- [x] Add ranked attack counters and statistics tracking
- [x] Implement ranked-specific CSV attack support
- [x] Add ranked hero management
- [x] Create ranked spell deployment functions
- [x] Add ranked siege machine support
- [x] Add ranked mode logging and debug features

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Create image templates for Normal/Ranked attack buttons (Requires actual game screenshots)

### ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Implement ranked attack validation and error handling (Helper functions needed)
- [ ] Test and validate all ranked functionality (Requires bot testing)
- [ ] Update documentation and user guide (Documentation phase)

## Files to be Modified/Created

### New Files Created:
- [x] `/COCBot/GUI/MBR GUI Design Child Attack - Ranked.au3` - Ranked GUI tab
- [x] `/COCBot/functions/Attack/RankedAttack.au3` - Ranked attack functions
- [ ] `/imgxml/imglocbuttons/NormalAttackButton_*.xml` - Normal button templates (Need screenshots)
- [ ] `/imgxml/imglocbuttons/RankedAttackButton_*.xml` - Ranked button templates (Need screenshots)

### Existing Files Modified:
- [x] `/COCBot/MBR Global Variables.au3` - Added ranked variables
- [x] `/COCBot/functions/Search/PrepareSearch.au3` - Added Normal/Ranked detection
- [x] `/COCBot/functions/Image Search/imglocAuxiliary.au3` - Added button detection
- [x] `/MyBot.run.au3` - Updated main bot loop
- [x] `/COCBot/MBR Functions.au3` - Added include for RankedAttack.au3
- [x] `/COCBot/GUI/MBR GUI Design Attack.au3` - Added ranked tab integration

## Key Features Implementation Status

### Attack Button Detection
- [x] Detect Normal Attack button
- [x] Detect Ranked Attack button  
- [x] Handle button position changes
- [x] Add fallback detection methods

### Daily Reset System (7 AM)
- [x] Calculate time until 7 AM reset
- [x] Implement reset check function
- [x] Save/load last reset timestamp
- [x] Handle timezone considerations

### Ranked Attack Counter
- [x] Track daily ranked attacks (0-8)
- [x] Persist counter across bot restarts
- [x] Display remaining attacks in GUI
- [x] Prevent attacks when limit reached

### Ranked Army System
- [x] Separate troop composition for ranked
- [x] Separate spell composition for ranked
- [x] Separate hero usage settings for ranked
- [x] Separate siege machine settings for ranked
- [x] Quick army presets for ranked mode

### Attack Logic
- [x] Bypass search in ranked mode
- [x] Attack first base immediately in ranked mode
- [x] Use ranked army composition
- [x] Deploy ranked spells and heroes
- [x] Support both Standard and Scripted ranked attacks

### GUI Components
- [x] Mode selection (Normal/Ranked)
- [x] Ranked attack counter display
- [x] Time until reset display
- [x] Ranked army composition interface
- [x] Ranked spell selection interface
- [x] Ranked hero selection checkboxes
- [x] Ranked strategy selection (Standard/Scripted)
- [x] CSV file selection for ranked scripted attacks

### Configuration System
- [x] Save ranked settings per profile
- [x] Load ranked settings on bot start
- [x] Reset mechanism for ranked attacks
- [x] Backup and restore ranked configurations

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test Normal mode (should work as before)
- [ ] Test Ranked mode attack flow
- [ ] Test daily limit enforcement
- [ ] Test 7 AM reset mechanism
- [ ] Test GUI updates and interactions
- [ ] Test config save/load functionality
- [ ] Test with different army compositions
- [ ] Test scripted ranked attacks
- [ ] Test hero deployment in ranked mode
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

## Notes and Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Normal mode
- Ensure clean separation between Normal and Ranked systems
- Add comprehensive error handling for ranked mode failures
- Include debug logging for ranked attack flow
- Consider user experience and intuitive GUI design
- Plan for future expansion (e.g., different daily limits, multiple ranked modes)
